#### Technology-Induced Trade Shocks ? Evidence from Broadband Internet Expansion in France <small class="text-muted"> with [Clément Malgouyres](https://sites.google.com/site/clementmalgouyres/), [Thierry Mayer](https://sites.google.com/site/thierrymayer/home) and [Juan Carluccio](http://juancarluccio.com/)</small> 
	
**Abstract** : *In this paper, we test for the presence of “technology-induced” trade in France between 2000 and 2007 and assess its impact on consumer welfare. We use the staggered roll-out of broadband internet to estimate its causal impact on the importing behavior of firms. Using an event-study design, we find that broadband expansion increases imports. Our estimates imply that the increase in the value of imports in the absence of broadband expansion would have been a 15% lower. We further find that the sub-extensive margin (number of products and sourcing country per firm) is the main margin of adjustment and that the impact is higher for capital goods. Finally, we develop a firm-based model of importing and adopt a sufficient statistics approach in order to quantify the contribution of the import-channel to the overall effect of broadband on consumer welfare. Within this model, our reduced-form estimates imply that broadband internet reduced the consumer price index by 1.7% and that the import-channel accounts for a quarter of that effect.*

#### Investment and the WACC: Firm-Level Evidence from France <small class="text-muted">  with [Juan Carluccio](http://juancarluccio.com/) and [Jean-Stéphane Mésonnier](http://jsmeson.pagesperso-orange.fr/) </small>  
	
**Abstract**: *We exploit a new dataset of consolidated balance sheets for some 1,850, mostly nonlisted,French  corporate  groups,  in  order  to  investigate  the  relationship  between  corporate  investment  and  the  cost  of  capital.  We construct firm-level measures of the weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  that  account  for  industry-specific  values  of  the cost of equity and reflect the actual capital structure of firms (data upon request). We find a confirmation that a high  WACC  drags  down  investment:  a  one  SD  increase  in  the  real  WACC  (+2  pp)  is associated  on  average  with  a  reduction  by  0.65  pp  in  the  investment  rate.  The  effect  is somewhat  larger  for  manufacturing  firms  and  when  firms  are  highly  leveraged  or  more  dependent  on  external  finance.*

#### Political Uncertainty, Risk of Frexit and European Sovereign Spreads <small class="text-muted"> with [Clément Malgouyres](https://sites.google.com/site/clementmalgouyres/) - **Applied Economic Letters**  </small> 

**Abstract** : *In this note, we use data from a prediction market (crowd-based forecasts) to build a daily measure capturing the risk of Frexit related to the 2017 French presidential elections. We show that political uncertainty drives not only the French sovereign spread but also the spreads of those EU countries deemed the most vulnerable to the risk of desegregation of the Euro Zone. These results suggest that specific political uncertainty affects short-term investor’s expectations and may outweigh other economic determinants of sovereign spreads shortly prior to high stake elections*
