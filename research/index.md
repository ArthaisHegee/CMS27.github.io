#### Technology-Induced Trade Shocks ? Evidence from Broadband Internet Expansion in France <small class="text-muted"> with [Clément Malgouyres](https://sites.google.com/site/clementmalgouyres/), [Thierry Mayer](https://sites.google.com/site/thierrymayer/home) and [Juan Carluccio](http://juancarluccio.com/)</small> 
	
**Abstract** : *In this paper, we test for the presence of "technology-induced" trade in France between 2000 and 2007. We use the staggered roll-out of broadband to estimate its causal impact on the importing behavior of firms. Using an event-study design, we find that broadband expansion increases imports. Simple counterfactuals suggest a 15 to 20 % lower rise of imports in the absence of broadband expansion. We find that intermediary and capital goods drive most of the effect. The sub-extensive margin (number of products and destinations per firm) is the main margin of ajustment. We adopt a sufficient statistics approach in order to quantify the contribution of the importing channel to the overall effect of broadband on the consumer price index. We find that broadband internet reduced the price index by 1.7 % and that the importing channel accounts for a quarter of that effect.*

#### Investment and the WACC: Firm-Level Evidence from France <small class="text-muted">  with [Juan Carluccio](http://juancarluccio.com/) and [Jean-Stéphane Mésonnier](http://jsmeson.pagesperso-orange.fr/) </small>  
	
**Abstract**: *We exploit a new dataset of consolidated balance sheets for some 1,850, mostly nonlisted,French  corporate  groups,  in  order  to  investigate  the  relationship  between  corporate  investment  and  the  cost  of  capital.  We construct firm-level measures of the weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  that  account  for  industry-specific  values  of  the cost of equity and reflect the actual capital structure of firms (data upon request). We find a confirmation that a high  WACC  drags  down  investment:  a  one  SD  increase  in  the  real  WACC  (+2  pp)  is associated  on  average  with  a  reduction  by  0.65  pp  in  the  investment  rate.  The  effect  is somewhat  larger  for  manufacturing  firms  and  when  firms  are  highly  leveraged  or  more  dependent  on  external  finance.*
